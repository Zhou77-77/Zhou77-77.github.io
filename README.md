This was a team project for one of my Columbia Engineernig course 'IEME E4200 - Human-Centered Design and Innovation'.
We proposed a community-focused caf√© designed to bridge the gap between Columbia University and the local Harlem neighborhood. 
Our goal was to create an affordable and accessible 'third space' that addresses student needs while also honoring Harlem's history 
and providing opportunities for local residents through features like community-curated art displays and local employment.

In particular, this course added a crucial human-centered perspective to my engineering 
studies, and I came to realize that it is not only technical competence that drives true 
innovation but also keen insight and empathy for diverse needs and social contexts.
